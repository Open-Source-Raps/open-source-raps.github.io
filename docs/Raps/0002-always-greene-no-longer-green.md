## Introduction
A rap and accompanying literature built for the Greene Scholars program Summer Camp at LinkedIn during Summer 2023.  
This is intended to teach basic programming through Python in one long lesson, that can be broken up into six parts.
Let's get into it and turn you into an engineer!~

## Getting Started
Follow the instructions on the [code repository](http://code.opensourceraps.com) README.md file to get setup with all the files for all exercises.
The files for this lesson are located at the path: `/raps/0002-always-greene-no-longer-green`.

### Part 1: Introduction
> With so many lessons in the world today,  
> We thought we would try to teach you in a different way,  
> I'm so sorry we couldn't get Ice Spice or Drake,  
> But we'll teach you how to be an engineer in just a day,  

Many tech companies believe that "talent can come from anywhere", such as [LinkedIn's REACH program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5l0IfnjyRw) (or others such as [Microsoft's LEAP program](https://leap.microsoft.com/en-US/) or [AirBnb's Connect program](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/inside-connect-airbnbs-engineering-apprenticeship-program-c26d6eb2768c)) where that phrase was taken and will nurture emerging talent to be successful.  
That said, you still need to have the basics under your belt!  We'll help you get there.  

If you follow along with these lesson and accompanying materials, we're sure you can learn basic programming in just a single day!

> To start out, let us shatter an illusion,  
> Programming languages, there’s so much confusion,  
> For a beginner they’re the same, no difference to the lessons,  
> Ignore confusing terms like “pointers” or “garbage collection”,  
> On your coding journey, pick the language that looks fun,  
> It all compiles down to the same 0s and 1s,  
 
Here are some of the programming languages you might have heard of, even if you're a programming neophyte:  
C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML, PHP, or Python

If you've had some exposure to programming, maybe you've heard of one or more of the following languages:  
C#, PERL, Ruby, or SQL



> I’m going to use Python 'cause it’s simple and it’s free,
> Plus, I met Guido van Rossum and he was nice to me,
