# Introduction
Welcome to Open Source Raps!  We're going to get you jamming with both your ears and hands in just minutes!!

Open Source Raps! is divided into "lessons", otherwise referred to as "raps" or "songs".  Each lesson is composed of a song that can replayed to help reinforce the concepts, a video that is meant for the initial viewing (since it can add additional context), and written documentation (usually with code, where applicable).

**Please note that the lessons are ordered (using a hexidecimal ordering system) in the order released and are intended to be consumed individually, in any order.**

## Getting Started
Follow the instructions on the [code repository](http://code.opensourceraps.com) `README.md` file to get setup with all the files for all exercises.  
Each lesson will have a separate directory with a `README.md` file to augment the music and video, as well as any other files that might be needed. 

If you would like to download the tutorials themselves, the source code for this site is available [here](http://github.com/open-source-raps/open-source-raps.github.io).
