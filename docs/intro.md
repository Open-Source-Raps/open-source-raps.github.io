# Introduction
Welcome to Open Source Raps!  We're going to get you jamming with both your ears and hands in just minutes!!

Open Source Raps! is divided into "lessons", otherwise referred to as "raps" or "songs".  Each lesson is composed of a song that can replayed to help reinforce the concepts, a video that is meant for the initial viewing (since it can add additional context), and written documentation (usually with code, where applicable).

**Please note that the lessons are ordered (using a hexidecimal ordering system) in the order released and are intended to be consumed individually, in any order.**

## Get Started
Follow the instructions on the [code repository](http://code.opensourceraps.com) `README.md` file to get setup with all the files for all exercises.  
Each lesson will have a separate directory with a `README.md` file to augment the music and video, as well as any other files that might be needed. 

If you would like to download the tutorials themselves, the source code for this site is available [here](http://github.com/open-source-raps/open-source-raps.github.io).

### Dependencies
Any additional dependencies (such as required binaries, scripts, libraries, or other artifacts) will be mentioned in the "Learning Materials" section of each lesson.

Common dependencies for most lessons are included below.

#### Python
Python is an extremely simple programming language that is installed by default across a majority of operating systems, so the majority of lessons that are demonstrating simple concepts will use Python.  If it is not installed on your system, you can do so easily at the [Python.org](https://www.python.org/).
